### Here are the neural network based models used to predict cyclizability 
These were originally produced in J Park, B Cieza, S Yan, A Basu, & T Ha. 2024. Probing mechanical selection from population genetics data through accurate prediction of DNA mechanics. (To be published):https://github.com/codergirl1106/Cyclizability-Prediction-Website/
This investigation purely made use of C0 cyclizability but the other models are provided as well
