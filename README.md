## Analysis of DNA flexibility using neural network models
Here are listed all the python scripts and code used throughout my research project. Many of the scripts utilise much of the code produced in the Cyclizablility prediction code script, with partial alterations to fit certain data or perform seperate analyses. 

__'Cyclizability Prediction Code':__
Original Code for predicting cyclizability around the Nucleosomes of schizosaccharomyces pombe and performing codon randomization 

__'Cerevisiae 1-9':__
Code used to predict cyclizability around cerevisiae nucleosomes and codon randomisation
